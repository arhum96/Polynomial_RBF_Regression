Polynomial and Radial Basis Function Regression

The purpose of this project is to show how to implement ordinary least squares regression using polynomial and radial basis functions.
Each type of basis function has its own domain where it produces reliable results compared to others. Polynomial basis functions allow
us to look at global trends while radial basis functions are more useful in identifying local patterns. You should be able to import the code and use it as well as understand it based on the extra comments provided.

IDE: PyCharm community 2019
Python version: 3.7

Running the tests
Randomly generated data was used to produce test data for polynomial regression. This data should be visualized using matplotlib. For the radial basis function, it was tested on a corrupted file of a jellyfish picture which is not provided.
