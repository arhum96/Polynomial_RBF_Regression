Polynomial and Radial Basis Function Regression

The purpose of this project is to show how to implement ordinary least squares regression using polynomial and radial basis functions.
Each type of basis function has its own domain where it produces reliable results compared to others. Polynomial basis functions allow
us to look at global trends while radial basis functions are more useful in identifying local patterns. 

Getting Started

IDE: PyCharm community 2019
Python version: 3.7

Running the tests
Randomly generated data was used to produce test data which can be visualized using matplotlib
For the radial basis function, it was tested on a corrupted file of a jellyfish picture
